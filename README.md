# ⚡ **Fun Fact**
My wanderlust was sparked early on – road-tripping across the U.S. with my parents, navigating state highways and quirky roadside attractions. As a high school exchange student and later living in Perth, Australia, I transformed those childhood adventures into a global passion for exploration. From family travels to solo international experiences, I've always believed the world is best understood through curious eyes and an open heart. Next destination? Always TBD! 🌍✈️
